# Article Workflow Management

Comprehensive management of article writing projects through progress tracking, dependency visualization, parallel work optimization, and quality assurance.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked:

**With existing project reference**:
```
Starting article workflow management for [file/topic]. Analyzing current status to propose optimal progression strategy.

Analyzing project status...
```

**For new project**:
```
Starting new article workflow management. Please provide:
1. Article topic/theme (rough idea acceptable)
2. Existing materials/thoughts documents
3. Target article format (research, analysis, opinion, etc.)
4. Target audience and output requirements
5. Current progress stage (ideation, research, writing, etc.)

Examples:
- `/manage_article_workflow supply-chain-attack-trends`
- `/manage_article_workflow thoughts/shared/research/articles/2025-01-08-ai-security-research.md`
- Want to turn existing research into article

Will analyze full project scope and propose efficient writing strategy.
```

Then wait for user input.

## Article Writing Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation
- **Topic exploration**: Theme validation, market analysis
- **Initial research**: Overview information gathering
- **Angle setting**: Unique value proposition definition

### Stage 2: Research
- **Deep investigation**: Detailed information collection
- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Different viewpoints, opposing views
- **Source verification**: Credibility, currency validation

### Stage 3: Planning
- **Structure design**: Logical flow, reader experience
- **Content strategy**: Section roles, content planning
- **Quality standards**: Success metrics, completion criteria

### Stage 4: Writing
- **Draft creation**: Initial writing per plan
- **Iterative improvement**: Adjustments, additional research
- **Consistency maintenance**: Tone, style, quality unity

### Stage 5: Review
- **Content verification**: Fact-checking, logic validation
- **Readability enhancement**: Writing quality, structure optimization
- **Publication preparation**: Final formatting, standards compliance

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Comprehensive Project Analysis

1. **Read existing materials completely**:
   - Specified thoughts documents, research materials, plans
   - Related article drafts or outlines
   - **Important**: Read full files without limit/offset parameters
   - **Critical**: Complete understanding in main context before sub-tasks

2. **Parallel project status investigation**:
   ```
   Task 1 - Existing Assets Inventory:
   Identify current project deliverables:
   1. Use thoughts-locator for related documents
   2. Confirm research docs, plans, drafts existence
   3. Evaluate completion status per stage
   4. Assess existing quality levels
   Return: Current project status map

   Task 2 - Topic Competition/Market Analysis:
   Analyze theme uniqueness and value:
   1. Use web-search-researcher for similar articles, trends
   2. Identify differentiation factors from existing content
   3. Discover reader needs, knowledge gaps
   4. Find timely angles, unique perspectives
   Return: Topic value analysis and differentiation strategy

   Task 3 - Dependencies/Resource Analysis:
   Identify project execution constraints:
   1. Required expertise, research domains
   2. External resource, expert dependencies
   3. Inter-stage dependencies, bottlenecks
   4. Quality standards, publication requirements
   Return: Constraints and resource requirements map
   ```

3. **Current vs. target gap analysis**:
   - Evaluate completion level per workflow stage
   - Assess quality level vs. target standards
   - Identify unresolved challenges, risk factors
   - Discover optimizable parallel work opportunities

### Step 2: Strategic Workflow Design

After investigation completion:

1. **Overall project strategy construction**:
   ```
   ## Project Strategy Analysis

   ### Current Status
   - **Stage**: [Foundation/Research/Planning/Writing/Review]
   - **Completion**: [% complete per stage]
   - **Quality Level**: [Current deliverable quality assessment]

   ### Final Goal
   [Article value proposition, reader value delivery]

   ### Intermediate Milestones
   - [Milestone 1]: [Concrete deliverable, completion criteria]
   - [Milestone 2]: [Concrete deliverable, completion criteria]

   ### Discovered Opportunities
   - [Efficiency opportunity]: [Specific improvement proposal]
   - [Quality opportunity]: [Specific enhancement measure]
   - [Differentiation opportunity]: [Uniqueness strengthening method]
   ```

2. **Dependency visualization and critical path**:
   ```
   ## Workflow Dependencies

   ### Sequential Execution Required (Critical Path)
   Foundation → Research → Planning → Writing → Review
   [Longest duration, bottleneck identification]

   ### Parallel Execution Possible
   - Foundation stage: [Multiple topic area simultaneous research]
   - Research stage: [Different sources/angles parallel investigation]
   - Writing stage: [Independent section parallel writing]

   ### Blockers and Solutions
   - [Blocker 1]: [Specific resolution approach]
   - [Blocker 2]: [Alternative methods, workarounds]
   ```

### Step 3: Execution Strategy Optimization

1. **Create workflow management plan with TodoWrite**

2. **Present stage-specific execution strategy**:
   ```
   ## Optimal Execution Strategy

   ### Immediately Executable (Parallel Processing)
   1. [Task A]: `/research_article [specific research domain]`
   2. [Task B]: [Independently executable research/validation]
   3. [Task C]: [Quality improvement, preparation work]

   ### Next Phase (Dependency Waiting)
   1. [Task D]: After research completion `/plan_article`
   2. [Task E]: After plan finalization `/write_article`

   ### Risk Mitigation
   - [Risk 1]: [Countermeasure, alternative plan]
   - [Risk 2]: [Advance preparation, validation method]
   ```

3. **Quality management and verification points**:
   ```
   ## Quality Checkpoints

   ### Stage Completion Criteria
   - **Research**: [Sufficient information volume, diversity, reliability]
   - **Planning**: [Logical structure, reader value, feasibility]
   - **Writing**: [Consistency, readability, goal achievement]
   - **Review**: [Accuracy, completeness, publication readiness]

   ### Continuous Verification Items
   - Reader value maintenance/improvement
   - Differentiation factor strengthening
   - Information currency, accuracy
   - Target quality level achievement
   ```

### Step 4: Execution Support and Monitoring

After strategy approval:

1. **Stage-specific execution guidance**:
   ```
   Starting execution support. Current optimal actions:

   ## Recommended Command Execution Order
   1. `/research_article [specific theme]` - Foundation research
   2. `/plan_article` - Structure design
   3. `/write_article` - Writing execution
   4. `/review_article` - Quality improvement

   ## Parallel Execution Opportunities
   - Research stage: [Multiple domain simultaneous research]
   - Verification stage: [Fact-checking and additional research parallel]

   Which stage should we start with?
   ```

2. **Progress tracking and adaptive adjustment**:
   - Quality evaluation at each stage completion
   - Strategy adjustment based on new information/constraints
   - Continuous discovery of parallel work opportunities
   - Early detection and response to blockers/risks

### Step 5: Quality Assurance and Optimization

During project progression:

1. **Continuous quality standards monitoring**:
   ```
   ## Quality Monitoring Results

   ### Current Quality Level
   [Detailed evaluation per stage, improvement points]

   ### Target Deviation
   [Gap analysis, necessity of countermeasures]

   ### Improvement Proposals
   [Specific improvement actions, priority order]
   ```

2. **Dynamic strategy optimization**:
   ```
   ## Workflow Optimization Proposal

   ### Efficiency Opportunities
   - [Parallelization proposal]: [Specific execution method]
   - [Process simplification]: [Efficiency under quality maintenance]

   ### Quality Enhancement Opportunities
   - [Additional verification]: [More reliable information collection method]
   - [Differentiation strengthening]: [Unique value addition method]

   Apply this optimization?
   ```
