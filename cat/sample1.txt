Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached on src or an error occurs. It returns the number of bytes copied and the first error encountered while copying, if any.

A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported.

If src implements WriterTo, the copy is implemented by calling src.WriteTo(dst). Otherwise, if dst implements ReaderFrom, the copy is implemented by calling dst.ReadFrom(src).
